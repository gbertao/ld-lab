# My ld-script lab
There are some codes used to learn how to use the ld-script language.

[exp 1](exp1): Write a binary that returns 10 as a status code using only the ld script.

[exp 2](exp2): Allocate a memory block to store the binary.

[exp 3](exp3): Allocate .data block.

[exp 4](exp4): Write to read-only memory. (Nothing happened, the read-only attribute was ignored).

[exp 5](exp5): Multi-part assembly combined at the link phase.
